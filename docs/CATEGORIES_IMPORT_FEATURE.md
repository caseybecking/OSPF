## Usage

### For Users

1. **Navigate to Categories**
   - Go to `/categories`
   - Click the upload icon button

2. **Upload CSV**
   - Drag and drop your CSV file OR
   - Click "Browse File" to select

3. **Review Results**
   - See how many categories were created
   - See how many duplicates were skipped
   - See groups and types processed

### For Developers

**API Endpoint:**
```bash
POST /api/categories/csv_import
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

# Form data:
file: <CSV file>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Categories imported successfully",
  "categories_created": 131,
  "categories_skipped": 0,
  "types_processed": 3,
  "groups_processed": 25
}
```

---

## CSV Sample Data

The repository includes a sample file at `/data/categories_data.csv` with:
- **131 categories**
- **25 groups** (Food & Dining, Auto & Transportation, Bills & Utilities, etc.)
- **3 types** (Income, Expense, Transfer)

---

## Technical Details

### Import Process Flow

1. **Validate** user is authenticated
2. **Check** file is provided and is CSV
3. **Save** file to uploads folder temporarily
4. **Parse** CSV and validate headers
5. For each row:
   - **Get or create** categories_type
   - **Get or create** categories_group
   - **Check** if category exists (by name + group + type)
   - **Skip** if exists, **create** if new
6. **Clean up** - delete uploaded file
7. **Return** statistics

### Database Efficiency

- Uses `query.filter_by().first()` to check existing records
- Caches type and group IDs in dictionaries during import
- Only one query per unique type/group name
- Prevents N+1 query problems

### Security

- ✅ Session-based authentication required
- ✅ File extension validation (.csv only)
- ✅ Secure filename handling with `secure_filename()`
- ✅ Temporary file cleanup after processing
- ✅ User ID from session (can't import for other users)

---

## Testing

### Test the Import

1. **Restart Flask app** to load new endpoints
2. **Navigate** to http://localhost:5000/categories
3. **Click** upload icon button
4. **Upload** the file `/data/categories_data.csv`
5. **Verify** results show imported categories

### Expected Results

With the sample `categories_data.csv`:
- ✅ 131 categories created
- ✅ 0 duplicates skipped (first import)
- ✅ 25 groups processed
- ✅ 3 types processed

**Second import:**
- ✅ 0 categories created
- ✅ 131 duplicates skipped
- ✅ 25 groups processed
- ✅ 3 types processed

## Error Handling

The system handles:

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| No file uploaded | `400: No file provided` |
| Empty filename | `400: No file selected` |
| Non-CSV file | `400: File must be a CSV` |
| Missing CSV headers | `400: CSV must have headers: ...` |
| Invalid CSV format | `500: Error processing CSV: ...` |
| Not authenticated | `401: User not authenticated` |

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Bulk Edit** - Update existing categories from CSV
2. **Export** - Download current categories as CSV
3. **Template** - Download blank CSV template
4. **Preview** - Show preview before importing
5. **Validation** - Client-side CSV validation before upload
6. **Mapping** - Allow custom column mapping
7. **Undo** - Ability to undo an import
